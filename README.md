## Fork Repo
If you intend to watch the course and repeat the same instructions in your own enviroment, then you *must* fork this repository into your own GitHub account. The reason for this, is that you need to be the *owner* of the repo to be able to upload and configure a new *Deploy Key* within the *Settings* area of the repo. The new *Deploy Key* will contain the Flux operators SSH public key.
